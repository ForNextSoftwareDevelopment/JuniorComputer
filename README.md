Assembler / DisAssembler / Emulator for the Elektor Junior Computer

This is an assembler/disassembler for the Elektor (Electuur) Junior Computer (MOS 6502 processor).
Currently I am restoring a Junior Computer and decided to make a simulator for debugging code I (will) write for it.

THIS IS A BETA VERSION, STILL WORKING ON IT !
